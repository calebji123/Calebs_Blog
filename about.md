# About

Welcome to my blog! It is a place for me to share my ideas, experiences, projects and struggles.

## Who am I

<!--author-->

## Why make this blog?

Over the years, many ideas and desires have fallen flat on the floor because I’ve had nowhere to express them. In a blog, I have a place to share what I like to do, which hopefully accentuates my motivation in all these aspects as well. I have realized that under extreme policy, many of my passions go undiscovered. Therefore, the blog will give me a reason to pursue them, for the interest of sharing it with others.

In addition, a blog serves as a record of what I have done. It is very insignificant for me to say I am interested in a subject, or I am proficient in a skill if I have nothing to show for it. It is almost like a public journal! Which is very helpful, because for some reason, I have never been able to keep a journal routine before. Writing is both a very useful skill and also one of my least developed. Well now I have a place to fix that!

Over the years, I have found out that there are so many avenues of interest that I have abandoned with no trace, because I was not committed enough or I lost motivation. A blog also can immortalize these aspects of my life, and give every little side interest a productive end goal, i.e. an article on my blog!

## What is on this blog?

This blog contains anything that interests me, anything that I have done that I am proud of, and basically anything I want to share with the world. Mainly, I will be talking about projects I am in the process of completing, or have completed. Projects in progress serve as development logs, and projects I have finished usually contain reflection about lessons and further ideas.

However, I am also very interested in learning about weird and sometimes very complicated things. The blog will serve as a great place to put all of my thoughts on these topics, as well as how I understood it, which may or may not be different from other people’s explanations.

Unfortunately, there is no definite answer to what is on this blog. I assure you that there are most definitely a lot of articles about computer science projects and math, but I do not know where I will delve into in the future. I already know that I will explore fiction writing and physics, which are definitely not the norm!
