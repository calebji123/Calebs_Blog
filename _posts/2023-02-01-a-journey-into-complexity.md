# A Journey into Complexity

So I recently released an article on the P versus NP problem. I constructed it from a simple understanding of the problem and minimal research. I decided that I was interested in learning more, so I started to dive deeper.

The problem soon devolved from a "solve the travelling salesman problem" to a: "let's try to find a minimal increment in complexity theory research because P versus NP won't be solved". It seems many years of failed research makes people pessimistic, especially the amateur mathematician money seekers.

However, I was not here to lament, but to learn. A quick search yielded the best looking introductory complexity theory book, "Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach" by Sanjeev Arora and Boaz Barak. I still have three months of my first undergraduate year. I'm sure I can read it!

To make sure I actually learn something, I will write articles on every major topic and link them below for your reference.
